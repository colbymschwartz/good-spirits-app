It embodies the principle that great cocktails need only a few quality ingredients—spirit, sugar, bitters, and ice—allowing the whiskey's character to shine. The drink became a symbol of timeless sophistication and remains the gold standard for evaluating a bartender's skill.",

    "history": "Created by Audrey Saunders at Pegu Club in New York around 2001, the Old Cuban is essentially a Mojito dressed in a tuxedo. Saunders took the classic Cuban template — rum, lime, mint, sugar — and elevated it with aged rum, Angostura bitters, and a champagne float. It became an instant modern classic and cemented Saunders' reputation as one of the most influential bartenders of the 21st century. The drink perfectly bridges casual tropical flavors with black-tie elegance.",

Dante won World's Best Bar in 2019, and the Garibaldi was their calling card.",
